![The small USRC bots.](usrc-1.jpg)

The USRC bot comes with two motorised wheels, a rolling ball third wheel, an arduino, a motor driver, and a bluetooth module. (All the parts are available to borrow, just come on up to the tron lab and you can have a play.)

The USRC bot can be controlled via a bluetooth phone app. It's designed to be really accessible to beginners, but if you know what you're doing then you might want to try the next tier up...
